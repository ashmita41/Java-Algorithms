# Binary Search

**Category**: Searching  
**Type**: Divide and Conquer

### What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a **sorted array**. It works by repeatedly dividing the search range in half and narrowing down the position of the target.

Instead of checking every element one by one (like linear search), binary search eliminates half of the remaining elements with each step.

### Where It's Used

- Search features in apps
- Indexing in databases
- System-level functions (e.g., lower_bound in C++)
- Games, AI logic, and more

### Why Use Binary Search?

- Time Complexity: **O(log n)**
- Space Complexity: **O(1)**
- Much faster than linear search for large datasets
