# Java Algorithms with Explanations

This repository is a personal collection of algorithms implemented in Java, created to strengthen core understanding of problem-solving and logic building.

Each algorithm includes:
- A clear explanation of the concept
- Pseudocode for easy understanding
- Well-commented Java code

---

## Update Schedule

I will be uploading **two algorithms every week**.  
Each entry will include:
- A short explanation of the algorithm
- Pseudocode outlining the steps
- Java implementation with comments

---

## How to Use

1. Browse the uploaded files.
2. Read the explanation to understand the logic.
3. Refer to the pseudocode for a high-level overview.
4. Review the Java code to see the working implementation.

This repository is intended to be simple, consistent, and helpful for building a strong foundation in algorithms using Java.
